# Mayo Front End Challenge

In this challenge, we would like you to build the front-end of a small web page from a prototype currently in Sketch.

### Design Specs

-   [Sketch Inspect](https://www.sketch.com/s/7731bba0-4b61-4792-a314-ed06234cc5e4): Will allow you to inspect for colors, padding, sizing, etc.  
    The design is also provided in static images within the assets > designs folder.

### Requirements

-   Build a working protoype based on provided design using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
-   The navigation should be populated using the navigation.json file.
-   The form button does not need to submit, however, it should have actual form elements.
-   The deliverables should be static HTML/CSS/JS files, if you decide to use a framework like Vue
    or React, please generate a static version of the page. While their use is not prohibited, the
    markup should be as clean and free of unnecessary elements.
-   Page should be responsive
-   Page should be optimized
-   Page should be 508 compliant
-   Page should be compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
-   Bonus: Add a date picker to the email form

\* Please do not use any UI frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap
